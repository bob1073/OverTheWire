# Level 1
Once we are inside level 0, we can use **ls** to list files in current directory. 
```console
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
```
Seems to be a file called *readme*. So lets read it! **cat** command will do the job.
```console
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL
```
And there we have the password to the next level.

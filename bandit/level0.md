# Level 0
The introductory level is pretty straight forward. The goal is to connect to bandit.labs.overthewire.org using **ssh**. According to **man ssh**,
we must follow the syntax \<user\>@\<host\> and optionally specify port with **-p** option. So:

```bash
$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
and submit password *bandit0*.
